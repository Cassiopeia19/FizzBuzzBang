# FizzBuzzBang:
This allows for numbers 1 thru 100 to be looked at to print out a word if:  
it is divisible by 3 = "Fizz", 
it is divisible by 5 = "Buzz", 
it is divisible by 7 = "Bang", 
it is divisible by 15 = "FizzBuzz", 
it is divisible by 21 = "FizzBuzzBang".  
It will also print out the number associated with the word, so that you can see if the calculation is correct.

This also tallys the counts of each, just to give the statistics.  The count variables are static field variables that have each been initialized as '0'.
